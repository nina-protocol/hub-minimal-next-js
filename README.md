This Repo is intended to show a minimal implementation of a self-hosted Hub.  It looks nice enough to be used by simply cloning the repo and inserting your own Hub handle into the `.env` file. 

It illustrates basic use of the `@nina-protocol/js-sdk` package as well as a basic app using the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` package.  

It should serve as the starting point for further customization.

## Example

This template was used to create the Nina Night site: [https://nights.ninaprotocol.com/](https://nights.ninaprotocol.com/)


## Getting Started

1. Copy contents of `.env.template` into `.env` at project root
2. Enter your Hubs handle in `NINA_HUB_ID` in `.env`
3. Install packages with `yarn`
4. Run `yarn dev`
